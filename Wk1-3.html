<!---I started by first creating my html template using shift !.  This gave me the template for the header and body. 
     Same as other pages.  The header also describes the purpose of this page which is having a table with more information 
     on the puppies.  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Puppy Details Page</title>
</head>
<!--Here is the link to the stylesheet-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Wk2.css">
<body>
<!--I added a header-->>
    <header><h1>Nevada Puppy Shelter</h1></header>
<!--This has a small paragraph with h2 with a welcoming message.  -->    
    <p><h2>Meet the Puppies!</h2></p>
<!--Here I created the table that has four columns and four rows.  The first column describes the other three such as breed 
    followed by the breed type.  In addition I added Age, weight, and color of dogs.  The table could easily be expanded both 
    in columns or rows as needed.  I also bolded the first column and capitalize to differentiate from other columns.    -->
    <table>
        <tr>
           <th>Breed</th>
           <th>Age</th>
           <th>Weight</th>
           <th>Color</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
           <td>Beagle</td>
           <td>5 months</td>
           <td>10 pounds</td>
           <td>Black/Brown</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>Frenchie</td>
        <td>8 months</td>
        <td>13 pounds</td>
        <td>Black</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>Yorkie </td>
        <td>7 months</td>
        <td>8 pounds</td>
        <td>Brown</td>
     </tr>
    </table>

    <!--Finally, these are the links to the other pages which have the pictures and form for contact information 
        in case a person is interested in adopting the puppies.-->
