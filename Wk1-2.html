<!---I started by first creating my html template using shift !.  This gave me the template for the header and body. 
     I was not asked to create a footer so did not.  This was the first html I created which was adding three pictures
     along with links to other pages. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ang="en">
<!--This is the header below,  I named it puppy shelter as my goal was to created a website for a puppy shelter
    having 3 puppies looking for a home.-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title><h1>Puppie Shelter</h1></title>
</head>
<!--Here is the link to the stylesheet-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Wk2.css">
<body>
    <!--I added a header-->>
    <header><h1>Nevada Puppy Shelter</h1></header>
<!--This is where the body of the page starts.  I added the first header with the title for the website describing 
    its purpose.  In this case being the three puppies looking for a home with 3 pictures which I saved to the folder
    so that I could reference them later.  I saved them as JPG files.  Next, I added the command img src with the relative
    path to the files so it could pull them up.  I added width of 300 pixels for all three pixels. In addition, I created an
    ordered list to represent the 3 dogs from left to right.  I have modified the images and added an ID to each to reference in CSS.    -->
